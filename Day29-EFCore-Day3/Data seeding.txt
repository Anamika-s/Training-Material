Data seeding is the process of populating a database with an initial set of data. There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core: Model seed data, Manual migration customization, and Custom initialization logic1. Model seed data can be associated with an entity type as part of the model configuration. Then EF Core migrations can automatically compute what insert, update or delete operations need to be applied when upgrading the database to a new version of the model1. This feature is most useful for static data thatâ€™s not expected to change outside of migrations and does not depend on anything else in the database1.

In general, data seeding is useful in scenarios where you want to provide some test data in the development environment2. However, it can also be used to set up the application for the first time in a production environment by providing the sample or useful master data2.
